# Lab-07
back end for city explorer app

# Project Name

**Author**: Bonnie Wang and Jagdeep Singh
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This site is being built so that we can get hands on experience with backend systems and produce an server that pulls from multiple databases and updates the information pulled regularly.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
step 1: Download the repository
step 2: In terminal window, enter 'npm install dotenv' and create a '.env' file containing port number and API keys.
step 3: Run nodemon and test routes (location, weather, meetups) and outputs.
step 4: deploy to a online service like heroku if desired.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
Technologies used: JavaScript, node.js, express, dotEnv, JSON, CORS, superagent.

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource.

## Credits and Collaborations
